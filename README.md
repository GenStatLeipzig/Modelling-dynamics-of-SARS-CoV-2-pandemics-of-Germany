Scripts and data accompanying Publication Kheifetz et al. "Modelling complete dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics of Germany and its federal states using multiple levels of data"


This repository contains the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript titled "Modelling complete dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics of Germany and its federal states using multiple levels of data" (Kheifetz et al., 2021). The repository is organized into three main folders: data, scripts, and results.

#### Data

The "data" folder contains the necessary data files required as input for the scripts located in the "scripts" folder. These files correspond to the data discussed in the paper.
